[ATM Management.c2.pdf](https://github.com/Dharshan8088/projects/files/6987609/ATM.Management.c2.pdf)


I have programmed in that above attached file with three features with security. And the security is user password. How my program actually works first it asks the user to enter the password and then it checks entered password matches with user password in database when it matches up it allows the user to access the services given by the bank 
As I said before the three features will be shown and asks the user to select from it. Next as per the user request it works like existing atm machines does. 
Three features that I have attached is,, 
1. Changing password 
2. Withdraw cash 
3. Check balance 
I have separated my program into three modules such as password tab, cash tab and SSD tab so I used three user defined functions to facilitate program.
(**for your kind notice : password is predefined so even though you change the password it doesn't change so anybody having any idea about that contact me dharshan8088@gmail.com i welcome it**)
